Context: This Discord bot handles submissions, TikTok handle linking, queues, and points tracking. The following functionality issues must be identified, repaired, and validated:
Queue pagination and auto-updating:
The queue display must be paginated for large lists.
Pages should automatically refresh when the queue changes.
Detect if current pagination logic exists; if missing or static, implement dynamic update listeners tied to message edits or interactions.
Submission channel cleanup:
In the submission channel, only allow messages from admins or the bot itself.
Automatically delete or ignore any message not from these sources.
Confirm correct permissions are used (Manage Messages or equivalent).
TikTok handle linking:
Linking system must use autocomplete from a locally stored list of known TikTok handles previously gathered from live sessions.
Validate that any entered handle exists in the database before linking.
Prevent multiple Discord users from linking to the same TikTok handle, but allow one Discord user to have multiple TikTok handles.
Generate error messages when a handle is invalid or already linked.
Submission storage and resubmission:
Submissions must be stored persistently (JSON, database, or equivalent).
Each submission should retain all metadata: user ID, timestamp, TikTok handle, and submission content.
Users must be able to view, select, and requeue their previous submissions.
Ensure data isolation — users may only access their own stored submissions.
Points tracking:
Points must be tracked per Discord account, regardless of linked TikTok handles.
Verify correct increment/decrement logic, database persistence, and leaderboard functionality.
Add periodic save/backup task to avoid data loss.
Instructions:
Scan all source files for relevant modules (queue, submission, points, tiktok_link, database, bot).
Identify functions that partially implement the above logic and analyze for completeness.
For missing or incorrect functionality, automatically generate and insert minimal, functional code patches that comply with Discord.py (or Pycord) standards.
Annotate all changes with # FIXED BY Replit comments for developer review.
Run static analysis to confirm no syntax errors or unreferenced functions remain.
Produce a concise structured report including:
Each issue number (1–5)
Files modified
Functions updated or added
Confidence level of correctness
TODOs requiring manual testing
Output the final report in JSON format.
