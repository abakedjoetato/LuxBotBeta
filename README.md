### Technical Features

- SQLite database for persistent storage
- Async/await for concurrency-safe operations
- Discord UI Modals and interactive components
- Comprehensive error handling and validation

## Setup on Replit

### 1. Environment Variables
Set the following environment variable in your Replit project:
- `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`: Your Discord bot token

To get a Discord bot token:
1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Create a new application
3. Go to the "Bot" section
4. Create a bot and copy the token
5. Add the token to your Replit environment variables

### 2. Bot Permissions
Your Discord bot needs the following permissions:
- Send Messages
- Use Slash Commands
- Manage Messages (for pinning)
- Read Message History
- Embed Links

### 3. Running the Bot
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the bot: `python main.py`

The bot will automatically:
- Initialize the SQLite database
- Load all command cogs
- Sync slash commands with Discord
- Set presence activity

## Usage

### Initial Setup
1. Use `/setline` commands to configure channels for each queue line
2. Users can start submitting music with `/submit`
3. Admins can manage the queue with admin commands

### Queue Management
- Submissions are processed in priority order: BackToBack → DoubleSkip → Skip → Free
- Each queue line displays real-time updates in its designated channel
- Users can only have one submission in the Free line
- Admins can move submissions between any lines
